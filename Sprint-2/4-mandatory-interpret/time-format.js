// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here, = Three times. 

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here = 0

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here  = pad(0) → "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here = (1), Because the last call to 'pad' uses 'remainingSeconds', and its value is 1, the value of 'num' is 1.
 

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here = The last call is pad(1), and "1".padStart(2, "0") returns "01".
